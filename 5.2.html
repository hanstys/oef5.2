				<h2>Wait what? </h2>
				<p> Why would a robot need to drink? Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. That's not soon enough! Anyone who laughs is a communist! You know, I was God once. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Daddy Bender, we're hungry.

Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Do a flip! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. </p>

				<h2>Sure!    </h2>
				<p>Can we have Bender Burgers again? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. You can see how I lived before I met you. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? We're rescuing ya.

Why would I want to know that? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!

That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."   </p>

				<p>  Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Kif might! OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.

File not found. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!

I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!

I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! </p>

				<h2>  4  </h2>
				<p>  I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Professor, make a woman out of me. Actually, that's still true. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?

Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. So, how 'bout them Knicks? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. It doesn't look so shiny to me.

It doesn't look so shiny to me. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Negative, bossy meat creature! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?

 </p>

				<p>  You don't know how to do any of those. Guess again. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Bite my shiny metal ass. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Yeah, lots of people did.

Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Guess again. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. </p>

				<h2>6    </h2>
				<p> Say it in Russian! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!

Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Bender, quit destroying the universe! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. We're rescuing ya. Also Zoidberg. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Oh sure! Blame the wizards!  </p>
